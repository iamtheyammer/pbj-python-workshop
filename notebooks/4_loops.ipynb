    "There are two main types of loops in Python: [`for` loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) and [`while` loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "They both run a segment of code over and over, but have different conditions determining:\n",

    "\n",

    "for i in range(0, my_ending_number):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above code runs, numbers 0-63 will print out.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also very common to use `range()` with [`len()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp), which finds the length of a variable (edit and run the code below!):"
