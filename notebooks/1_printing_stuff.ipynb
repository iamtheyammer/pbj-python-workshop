    "\n",
    "When running in this environment, they are not actually needed. However, if these ran on the console (we'll talk about the console later), Python would print out the prompt, then immediately ask for input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are those plus `+` signs doing there?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use plus signs `+` to \"append\" pieces of information together. However, they are literally appended:\n",

    "```py\n",
    "first = \"Sponge\"\n",
    "last = \"Bob\"\n",
    "full_name = first + last\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning that there is no space added. You'd have to manually add the space, as in the example you ran above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "full_name = first + \" \" + last\n",
    "print(full_name) # Sponge Bob\n",
    "```\n",

    "The plus operator in Python is quite versatile and can be used to append lots of things, including arrays. Of course, it can add numbers together, too."
