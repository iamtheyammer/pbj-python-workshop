    "With a little scaffolding (provided below), you absolutely have the skills to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the general steps, matched to the concepts you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask for the first number\n",
    "  - `input()` via the `input_number()` function\n",
    "2. Ask for the operand (+, -, *, or /)\n",
    "  - `input()`\n",
    "  - - `while` loop to let the user enter numbers until they enter a valid one!\n",
    "3. Check if the operand is valid\n",
    "  - `if` statements\n",
    "  - `while` loop to let the user enter operands until they enter a valid one!\n",
    "3. Ask for the second number\n",
    "  - `input()` via the `input_number()` function\n",
    "  - `while` loop to let the user enter numbers until they enter a valid one!\n",
    "4. Do the calculation\n",
    "  - `a + b` / `a - b` / etc. (see 3_conditionals.ipynb)\n",
    "5. Print the result\n",
    "  - `print()` (this is already provided in the scaffolding code)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error, read it from **bottom to top**, and see if you can find a solution. Some tips and tricks are provided below the code."
